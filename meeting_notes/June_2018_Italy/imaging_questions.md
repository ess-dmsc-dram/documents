# Basic Imaging Questions

1. What are the build-out phases for the instrument? 
   * What are the expected completion dates?
   * What will the rates be at that point in time?
   * How many detectors will you have at that point in time   
     *Plan currently is to use the same MCP detector IMAT uses.*
1. What sorts of experiments do you plan to run and when?   
   *Initally 3D tomography, later on energy or time resolved tomography.*
1. How important will live, in-situ processing be?
1. Do you intend to do all your data processing in Mantid, what other tools do you intend on using or providing to users?   
   *Plan is to use MuhRec/KipTool for tomography (see https://github.com/neutronimaging/imagingsuite), software from SNS or J-PARC for Bragg edge fitting*
1. Who is the best point of contact for DR needs for the instrument?   
   *Anders Kaestner*
1. What are your largest concerns when it comes to data reduction for imaging?

Owen Arnold would be happy to meet, or follow up with a video conference call or face-to-face meeting.

Additional points:
- I didn't see any provision for >3D data
- Anders is happy to assist in providing access to MuhRec processing from Savu
- MuhRec is CPU based
